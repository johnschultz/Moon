This weekend has been quite stressful. Quite a bit of energy has been vented. Mainly through my migraines in my head. Painfully.

It started on Thursday morning, when Jasper discovered a weakness in the in the security system preventing access to "outside". Namely, the door latch was broken and with a little pressure he was able to open the door and escape. My only notice was when I woke up in the morning to a freezing apartment and no cat.

Jasper did eventually come back later Thursday, but it was quite stressful experience. Friday I had a bit of headache, Saturday I had a migraine on the left side of my head in the evening, and Sunday I had the same thing on the other side of my head. I only started to feel better once I took my strong medication and then puked. The pain had been so bad that I went to bed at 11AM and skipped lunch -- thus the bad reaction with the medication. 

On the plus side, Rick and Morty is tonight. We get to meet **_The Vindicators!_**
